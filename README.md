# coda
CODA is a smart assistant that I've began to rewrite as the original code was very old and bad. New features include gpt-3 integration and a new framework for making modules.

C.O.D.A stands for Cognitive Operational Data Assistant, but this project was originally called HADES, aka Home And Data... something or other
